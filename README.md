# Leetcode-solution-cpp
Structured LeetCode solutions with optimized approaches, complexity analysis, and DSA pattern categorization.


🚀 LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems solved as part of my Data Structures & Algorithms practice.

The goal of this repository is not just to solve problems, but to:

Strengthen problem-solving skills

Master common DSA patterns

Prepare for coding interviews

Track consistency and improvement

🧠 Approach

For each problem, I focus on:

Understanding brute-force approach first

Optimizing time and space complexity

Identifying patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, DP, Graphs, etc.)

Writing clean and readable code
